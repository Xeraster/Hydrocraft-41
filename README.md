# Hydrocraft
This is a fork of the hydrocraft 41 continued repository. I have made various fixes that will hopefully make it into the main branch

So far, these are the changes I've made:

- remade the Uzi model and texture. It was just a tad too small and due to the nature of the .X file format, I was unable to import it.
- changed it so that the hydrocraft uzi model gets used instead of a generic vanilla pistol model
- changed it so that the hydrocraft uzi icon gets used
- resized the hydrocraft uzi icon so that it shows up correctly
- added an aa12 icon

things I want to implent but haven't done yet:

- fix the aa12 model so that it doesn't clip through the player's shoulder (I can import the .x file but the uv mapping doesn't persist, so I'd had to redo that)
- make a model for the improvied backpack
